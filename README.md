# ProjectileMotion
Using Machine Learning to analyze experimental projectile motion data

## Intention and motivation
This repository is intended to store the code and the progress of a scientific initiative. The idea is to start a project where it can mix physics and Machine Learning, both areas where I have a big interest in studying.

Basically, the intention is to use machine learning models to help to predict the results a task of a physic experiment...

## Execution
To execute a model, from the root project, run:

```
python -m src.models.model_name
```
The outputs will be stored in te results directory, with the name of the model

## Todo
* Complet the README
* Make a pipeline for each algorithm
* Collect more data
* Generate synthetic data
* API automation to read the data
* Automation tests
* Deploy the models
